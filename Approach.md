# Approach to solve the travel assignment
I splitted this use case into following different small user-story.

1) To understand all the endpoints in the service mock project using postman.
2) Design & code the travel-client-rest and test all the services using postman.
3) Design & code the frontend which consume the travel-client-rest.
4) Manual Testing of all the services by running all above step 1,2,3.
5) Design and code the statistics in travel-client-rest and test all the services using postman. 
6) Design and code the statistics in frontend which consume the travel-client-rest
7) Manual integration testing of all the services.
8) Documentation  such as comments, writing Readme file for frontend and backend.
9) Run and test all the application as Production ready app.


# Improvement required
1) Writing Unit and Integration Test of Frontend and Backend
2) Code Quality/Code Coverage using SonarQube of Frontend and Backend
3) Security Testing 
4) Performance/Load/Regression Testing
